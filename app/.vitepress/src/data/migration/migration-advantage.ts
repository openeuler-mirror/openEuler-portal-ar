      "Today's digital world requires operating systems (OSs) to accommodate more computing architectures. For enterprise digital transformation, migrating OSs is a common operation, but this can often lead to like performance, compatibility, system environment restoration issues. openEuler is an open source OS that streamlines the differences between various computing architectures across servers, clouds, edges, and embedded systems. To make OS migration simple, reliable, and efficient, the openEuler migration solution comprises just six steps: create a migration support team, analyze migration needs, design a plan, adapt software, perform migration, and conduct testing and rollout. That brings us to x2openEuler, an openEuler tool designed for migration assessment and in-place upgrades.",
